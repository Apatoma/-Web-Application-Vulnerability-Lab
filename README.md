The platform features multiple vulnerable web pages where users can exploit common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, and Authentication Bypass. Additionally, it provides tools for code analysis and report generation, making it an ideal resource for improving web security skills.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Multiple Vulnerabilities**: Practice exploiting common vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, and Authentication Bypass.
- 🛠️ **Code Analyzer Tool**: Automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in your code.
- 📊 **Report Generator**: Generate detailed security reports based on the findings from the code analyzer.
- 🎓 **Educational Focus**: Perfect for students and professionals aiming to enhance their web security knowledge.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

- `/challenges/`: Contains HTML files for different vulnerability challenges.
- `/css/`: Contains the stylesheet for the web application.
- `/js/`: Contains JavaScript files (optional) for additional interactivity.
- `/tools/`: Contains Python scripts for code analysis and report generation.
- `index.html`: The main landing page for the platform.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** (for running code analysis tools)
- **A modern web browser** (for accessing the web application)

### Installation
